#### Step 1: Create Your Account

Start by navigating to AION's login screen.

1. Click `Sign up` to create a new account
2. Alternatively, use `Continue with Google` for faster authentication

Once logged in, you'll see the AION console with a navigation sidebar on the left.


#### Step 2: Upload Your SSH Key

SSH keys enable secure access to your GPU instances. You'll need to upload your public key before creating an instance.

`To upload your SSH key:`

1. In the left sidebar, navigate to `Management → SSH`
2. Click to upload your `public SSH key`
3. Give your key a memorable name or label for easy identification

Your uploaded key will now appear in the `SSH Key` dropdown when creating instances.

> `Important:` If you skip this step, you won't see any SSH key options later. Simply return to `Management → SSH`, upload your key, then continue with instance creation.



#### Step 3: Create Your GPU Instance


1. In the left sidebar, click `Home`, then select `GPU Instances`. You'll see an empty state with a green `Create Instance +` button in the center.
2. Click on the `Create Instance +` to start provisioning a new instance. You’ll see an interactive world map with all available regions and their pricing.
3. Review the available regions and their pricing and then Click `Provision` on your chosen region's card.
4. After selecting a region, you'll need to select or create a new project. You can use an existing project or create a new project.
    In the `Create New Project` section, enter:
    - `Project Name` (required)
    - `Project Description` (optional but helpful for organizing workloads)

    Click `Next` to proceed to configuration.

5. Now you'll define and configure the specifics of your GPU instance. Key configuration fields:

    |                |                                                           |
    | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `Cluster Name` | Choose a name you’ll recognize in your instances list.                 |
    | `Nodes`        | Use the **– / +** controls to set the number of machines in your cluster. |
    | `Image`        | Select your base software environment.                                 |
    | `SSH Key`      | Select the SSH key you uploaded in Step 2.                             |


6. Review your configuration one final time, then click the green `Launch` button in the Summary panel.

Your new instance will appear in the `GPU Instances` page, where you can monitor its status and access connection details.


#### Step 4: Connect via SSH

Once your instance is running, open it from the `GPU Instances` page to view connection details.

Now to connect to the GPU instance use the following SSH command format:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your/private_key <username>@<INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP>
```

Here are some Important details:
- `Private key:` Use the private key that corresponds to the public key you uploaded to AION
- `Username:` This depends on your selected image
  - Ubuntu-based images typically use `ubuntu`
  - Check your instance details for the correct username

**Example command:**

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/aion_key ubuntu@203.0.113.45
```

Once connected, you're ready to start running your workloads on your GPU instance!


#### Next Steps

Now that you're connected, you can:
- Install additional software packages
- Upload your datasets and models
- Start training or running inference
- Monitor GPU usage and performance
