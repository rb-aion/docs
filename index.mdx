aion gives you true on-demand GPU infrastructure plus a unified workspace that connects the core AI workflow in one place: **data → training & fine-tuning → deployment**.

Instead of hunting for capacity, wiring together multiple tools, or guessing at costs, teams use aion to go from idea to production faster and with more control. aion vertically integrates the compute stack from bare metal through inference, so you can focus on building, shipping, and operating AI systems with clear visibility into performance and spend.
